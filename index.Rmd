### Materials

You should have access to a laptop and bring it to every class, fully charged. Texts and readings will be assigned as needed. The instructor and TA's will support computation in R/RStudio. 

Helpful resource materials for the course include the following.

- Hoff, CSSS - Statistics 560 Lecture notes (Sakai)

- [Gelman and Hill, Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models](https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Regression-Multilevel-Hierarchical-Models/dp/052168689X)


### Topics and Important Dates

STA 610 contain a mixture of lecture and lab sessions. Mini-assessments will be provided in lab to check mastery and identify areas for additional focus.

Note: this schedule is approximate and is likely to be modified as the course progresses. Assignments are due at the beginning of class unless otherwise specified.
